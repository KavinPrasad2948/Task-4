# TASK 4


## Anonymous Functions and IIFE Functions:


> Here's a brief overview of each task:

1. **Print Odd Numbers in an Array**: This task prints all odd numbers in an array. The anonymous function and IIFE both iterate through the array and log odd numbers to the console.

2. **Convert All Strings to Title Caps in a String Array**: This task converts all strings in a string array to title case. The anonymous function and IIFE use the `map` method to capitalize the first letter of each string and convert the remaining letters to lowercase.

3. **Sum of All Numbers in an Array**: This task calculates the sum of all numbers in an array. The anonymous function and IIFE use the `reduce` method to add up all the numbers in the array.

4. **Return All Prime Numbers in an Array**: This task returns all prime numbers in an array. The anonymous function and IIFE use a helper function `isPrime` to check if a number is prime, and then filter the array accordingly.

5. **Return All Palindromes in an Array**: This task returns all palindromes in an array. The anonymous function and IIFE use a helper function `isPalindrome` to check if a string is a palindrome, and then filter the array accordingly.

6. **Return Median of Two Sorted Arrays of the Same Size**: This task returns the median of two sorted arrays of the same size. The anonymous function and IIFE merge the arrays, sort them, and then calculate the median.

7. **Remove Duplicates from an Array**: This task removes duplicates from an array. The anonymous function and IIFE use the `filter` method to keep only the first occurrence of each value.

8. **Rotate an Array by K Times**: This task rotates an array by `k` times. The anonymous function and IIFE use the `slice` method to split the array at the `k`th index and then concatenate the two parts in reverse order.

## Arrow Functions


1. **Print Odd Numbers in an Array**: This task uses the `filter` method to return a new array containing only the odd numbers, and then uses the `forEach` method to log each odd number to the console.

2. **Convert All Strings to Title Caps in a String Array**: This task uses the `map` method to capitalize the first letter of each string and convert the remaining letters to lowercase.

3. **Sum of All Numbers in an Array**: This task uses the `reduce` method to add up all the numbers in the array.

4. **Return All Prime Numbers in an Array**: This task uses a helper function `isPrime` to check if a number is prime, and then uses the `filter` method to return a new array containing only the prime numbers.

5. **Return All Palindromes in an Array**: This task uses a helper function `isPalindrome` to check if a string is a palindrome, and then uses the `filter` method to return a new array containing only the palindromes.
